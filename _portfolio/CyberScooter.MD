# Purpose

Commercial syringe pumps are widely used in clinical and laboratory settings, but their high cost can limit accessibility despite relying on relatively simple mechanical and electrical principles. For this project, I set out to design and fabricate a low-cost, programmable syringe pump using additive manufacturing and embedded control. The goal was to create a device capable of delivering precise, non-pulsatile flow while remaining adaptable to different syringe sizes and easy to modift. By combining CAD design, FFF 3D printing, stepper motor driven linear actuation, and Arduino-based control, I developed a fully functional pump conpatible with both 10 mL and 20 mL syringes. The final design integrates user controls, visual status feedback, and enclosed electronics.

## Key features include:
* Compatibility with 10 mL and 20 mL syringes
* Stepper motor driven lead screw for smooth, precise actuation
* Adjustable limit switch to prevent excess compression/decompression
* Start/pause control with visual status feedback (RGB LED)
* Enclosed electronics designed to protect against liquid exposure
* Fully 3D printed structural components with no adhesive bonding
